<h1 id="our-awesome-30th-anniversary-trip-to-japan">Our Awesome 30th Anniversary Trip to Japan</h1>

<p>In late October of 2019, Sue &amp; I traveled to Japan for our (delayed) 30th
anniversary trip.  We had an amazing time.  This is a blog post about our
adventures.</p>

<h2 id="first-stop-tokyo">First Stop &ndash; Tokyo</h2>

<p>We flew on Friday evening, 10/25/2019, to Haneda airport.  The flight
(which was on ANA) took off three hours late for no obvious reason,
and landed two hours late.  Imagine our shock when, after clearing
customs, ANA employees flagged us down and gave us each 15,000 Yen
(around $150 each) as compensation for a late arrival!</p>

<p>As it was nearly midnight on Saturday night, we just went to our hotel
(the Century Southern Tier, located conveniently at the Shinjuku
train station), and went to sleep.</p>

<h3 id="sunday-10-27">Sunday <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub></h3>

<ul>
<li>Senso-Ji (Shinto) shrine. Crowded market plaza and big shrine.</li>
<li>Akihabara — conveyor belt sushi. Was great!</li>
<li>Walking tour of Akihabara: AKB48, “Otaku” (geek) culture, MaidCafe, Confucian temple, Shinto shrine (great ice cream), Ueno. Hiroshi was very informative and entertaining.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="monday-10-28">Monday <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub></h3>

<ul>
<li>Walking tour Tokyo Localized by Emi of Meiji-jingu and Harajuku. Started with Meiji shrine — in a beautiful tree lined setting. Then Takeshita Street — crazy street lined with sweet food and cute stuff and some goth for Japanese teen girls — kind of crazy. Then Yoyogi Park for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Then traditional coffee house Chatei Haitou — amazing coffee!! ( he used Kalita with three holes and Melita filters)</li>
<li>Shibuya crossing— amazing!</li>
<li>Shibuya Hikarie department store/ mall.</li>
<li>Walked home back thru Meiji Jingu and parts of Shibuya.</li>
<li>Udon Shin noodles for dinner in this tiny shop in Shibuya</li>
<li>Went back to Tokyu Hands store. Many floors, one dedicated just to crafts!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tuesday-10-29">Tuesday <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub></h3>

<ul>
<li>Went to meet artist Kazuko Shihashi. She showed us her art and performed a tea ceremony— very beautiful!<br /></li>
<li>Went to borderless labs art exhibit. Very cool.</li>
<li>Had sushi in “Shinjuku Times Square” building and then checked out the coffee stuff at Tokyu Hands below it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wednesday-10-30">Wednesday <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub></h3>

<ul>
<li>Visited the East Gardens of the Imperial Palace grounds. Afterwards up to the Lawn with the small village being built specifically for a ceremony for the new emperor (!!)</li>
<li>Then to Ginza and Ginza crossing. Itōya — a 12 floor stationery store!  Bought some cards and had lunch at cafe on top floor.</li>
<li>Cafe de l’ambre — OG coffee shop of Tokyo. Aged beans (!). Coffee much smaller than Chatei Hatou and much more cramped and rushed. Coffee was also better at CH.</li>
<li>Hama-rikyu gardens. Previously shore recreational lands of the Shoguns and then the Emperor after the restoration. Now a public park. Carefully reconstructed tea house and other buildings.</li>
<li>Night tour of Shinjuku. First Memory Lane AKA Piss Alley — yakitori and beer in dozens of tiny places in a smoky alley. Kibuki Town  — restaurants with also people recruiting for some dangerous other restaurants. Don’t go with them. Then Red Light District— 5 different kind of sexual services: massage, escort, X, Y, and Soap Houses. Prostitution illegal but weirdly this just means intercourse. That is only available in soap house — pay girl directly so nobody sees. Then there are host_hostess clubs. No sex. Just girlfriend_boyfriend experience. Hugely expensive and most famous boy made 2.2M$ in a year. Then Love hotels: 2 hours, 6 hours, overnight. Very commonly used by Japanese. Most have been for various reasons. Finally Golden Gai — 100 small (ten person) themed bars which are pretty much the only place Japanese who are not in the same group will speak to each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-stop-hakone-and-the-foot-hills-of-mt-fuji">Next Stop, Hakone and the Foot Hills of Mt Fuji</h2>

<p>On Thursday morning we got on a JR bullet train and headed to Odawara,
thence to a small train to Hakone, and then a taxi to our &ldquo;semi-traditional&rdquo;
hotel &ndash; the Manatei spa.</p>

<h3 id="thursday-10-31">Thursday <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>31</sub></h3>

<ul>
<li>Bullet train to Odawara and almost didn’t get off. Train to Hakone and taxi to Manatei spa.</li>
<li>Hakone Open Air Museum. Many sculptures including a whole Picasso section.</li>
<li>Amazing meal at the spa.   Multiple courses in private room in the restaurant. Meal designed so we could eat everything!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="friday-11-1">Friday <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub></h3>

<ul>
<li>Bus to cable car (we call it a funicular) to “rope way” (what we call a cable car gondola) to boat. Great views of Mt Fuji. Ended in Hakonemachi at the shogun checkpoint museum.</li>
<li>Then we walked to MotoHakone and  walked further along the lake. Visited Hakone shrine.</li>
